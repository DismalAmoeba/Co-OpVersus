//the equation for vertical projectile motion is y=(initial velocity)*t*sin(angle)-(1/2)*g*t^2
//where t = time, unit doesn't matter as long as it's scaled with g
//g = the coefficient of gravity, which can be increased or decreased depending on what we want.  For realistic effects, we can make this number equal to 5 times the height of the player, assuming the player is human-sized.
//the equation for horizontal motion, assuming a lack of friction, is much simpler.  x=(initial velocity)*t*cos(angle)
//all things considered, most games do not use this, and instead have a constant angle (usually 90 degrees) for vertical motion, with horizontal motion determined by the movement keys as normal, allowing for aerial control of the character
